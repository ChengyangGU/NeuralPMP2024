# NeuralPMP2024


This code project is an implementation of Neural-PMP, a data-driven optimal control method for general systems with unrevealed dynamics, based on Pontryagin Maximum Principles (PMP). Please find the technique details in our paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.14566.pdf, by Chengyang GU, Hui Xiong and Yize Chen ( The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) ).

Note that this project does not contain all experiments in the paper, and is still being updated. The authors are working to packaging all codes. Please check the latest version at any time.
